             Why we need Recursion ??

1. It helps us in solving Bigger / Complex problems in a simple way.

2. You can convert Recursion Solution into iteration & vice versa.

3. Space Complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.

4. It helps us in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems.


              How to understand & approch a problems

1. Identify if you can break your problem in smaller problem

2. Write the reccurence relation if needed.

3. Draw the recursive tree.

4. About the tree : 
    * See the flow of function, How they are getting in stack.
    * Identify & focus on Left tree calls & Right tree calls :
      - Draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen and paper.
      - Use a debugger to see the flow.

5. See how values & what type of values(int, String etc.) are returned at each step.
   See where the function call come out of, In the end, You will come out of the main function.

VIMP :-  Variables : 1. Arguments
                     2. Return type
                     3. Body of the function
