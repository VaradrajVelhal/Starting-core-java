        1. Abstract Class

        An abstract class is a partially implemented blueprint.
        It can have both normal and abstract methods.
        

        You cannot create an object of an abstract class. You can create child class and create child classes 
        object to use abstract class members.

        if you diclare one member of normal class Abstract then you will have to nmake whole class abstract


         2. Abstract Method

          An abstract method is a method without a body.
          It just declares what should happen, but not how.

          abstract void sound();  // No body here

          Only abstract classes can have abstract methods.
       
       
       Why use abstract?

    To force subclasses to provide specific behavior.

    To create a common structure with some shared code and some incomplete parts.   */
