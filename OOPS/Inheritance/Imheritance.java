        //inheritance means using parent class properties in child class

        // Types of Inheritance 
        // 1. Signle Inheritance -> One class inherites from one superclass its called single Inheritance with
        //extends keyword.

        // 2. Multilevel Inheritance -> A class inherits from a class, which itself inherited from another class.

        // 3 . Hierarchical Inheritance -> Multiple classes inherit from the same superclass.
        

        //In java we cannot use multiple Inheritance directly because if the both parent class will have same method
        //name child class will be confused if we use that method ,Which one to call?
        //Thats why multilevel Inheritance can be achived by Interface.

        //Interface -> Interface has all its member public by default, Every members are static.
        //Every member is final(Constant), you cannot make object of interface 
    }
